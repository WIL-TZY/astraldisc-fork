			<p class="center">

			</p>
			<p>
				Technically this is the second newsletter in our arsenal, but here's a proper greeting... HELLO, AND WELCOME!
			</p>
			<p>
				This marks the start of our seasonal newsletters that we release "whenever we want during the season" or
				if there's substantial progress with the projects. We felt this was necessary to keep fans of the project
				engaged and also to give you guys some news from time to time, no matter how small they may be.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also know that Halloween is coming soon, and that it is a very special date for all of us, obviously because it's when
				Chapter 1 of DELTARUNE released. Back then, the fandom was way smaller, and there was a SERIOUS lack of AUs... Good thing
				Chapter 2 came around to fix that!
			</p>
			<p>So let's get into the meat of this thing already...</p>
			<p class="center">
				<img class="pixelated" src="../assets/img/newsletters/2024/autumn/dynamo_cutscene_ch3.png">

			</p>
			<p>
				We are making TONS of progress on the Andromedia Chapters 3-7 project.
				Seriously, you should see our Github push activity!
				With this, we're getting closer and closer to releasing the actual installments of the series, and while we
				cannot give you guys an actual date, we have a soft deadline set for us after our new production method started.
				More and more stuff is being coded, sprited and brainstormed, so maybe we'll even have some playable <em>secret</em> fights somewhere
				down the road (kind of a big maybe).
			</p>
			<p>
				We're slowly but surely implementing new mechanics and gimmicks for each chapter,
				which are usually fitting with their themes. Speaking of which, I'm not sure where Toby
				got the idea that a teacup ride somehow goes hand in hand with an internet themed Dark World...
				Unless he wanted to keep the carnival theming going... We don't know. But hey!
				Who's to defy the dog?
			</p>
			<p>In Andromedia, we're not trying to be the dog anyways...</p>

			</p>

			<p>(The latest official newsletter did surprise us with the balloon being teased specifically for Chapter 5... Lizzy was ecstatic.)</p>
			<p style="color:var(--lisspeed); text-shadow: none;">
				<span style="font-family: var(--main-font); font-size: 25px; text-shadow: none;">Lisspeed:</span><br>
				Honestly, when designing my theme park Dark World, it was always done because I love theme parks, haha!
				Originally the idea was to make a fully abandoned theme park because I was curious on how that would play out, especially with how secret bosses are based on abandoned objects.
			</p>
			<p style="color:var(--lisspeed); text-shadow: none;">
				So what would happen if an entire place was abandoned?. Sadly I couldn't get it executed in a way that made sense, so it was turned into a trip outside of Hometown, giving the
				Fun Gang more of a reason to be there. When I made this concept the idea was always: "The probability of this is impossible, but if we're making an AU, might as well go all out."
			</p>
			<p style="color:var(--lisspeed); text-shadow: none;">
				So seeing that balloon was absolutely hilarious to us, because the mere prospect of my intentionally outlandish idea having some ground to stand on
				AND IN CHAPTER 5 OF ALL THINGS is wild to me!

			<h2 class="center">More Progress...?!</h2>
			<p>
				We've made substantial progress in recreating Castle Town's mechanics and locations for the different chapters!
				At least one expansion map for Castle Town was made for Chapter 3, and we've pretty much completed the Cafe Placement
				mechanic + Dojo Challenges menu as well. Chapter 4 Cafe was also made, along with BPM related gimmicks...
			</p>
			<p>I have to thank a few people on the Kristal server for all the help!</p>

				Some more progress we've made include... Cutscenes! Test cutscenes! Shops! Test shops! Shops that rewrite the whole UI for some reason!
				Seriously, though... we're incredibly happy with all the stuff that's been done so far, especially after we've spent a while without news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Burnout and lack of motivation (fueled by the stagnant wait for the official chapters) tends to hit at the worst moments and that was no different
				for our team. However, after welcoming in some more members and setting up a new production schedule, we're foreseeing this project to
				have a good amount of content soon!

			<h2 class="center">Soundtrack Update</h2>
			<p class="center">

				<div class="newsletter-credit">Spritework by Toosday</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				Our plan going forward is to slowly revamp and remaster most of the current soundtrack, so you'll be seeing changes
				and updates of old songs. We have decided to do this because we think some tracks either don't fit the characters, sound
				extremely dated, or are just overall not a good result...
			</p>
			<p>
				After bringing in very talented musicians from the community,
				we have started this process and will be posting the new tracks on HUECYCLES's SoundCloud account (because that's where she has
				Next Pro and they can't afford another plan lol), with some "special" songs being posted on YouTube as well whenever we're ready.

				"But what about Candleholder?! Is it still on hiatus???""

				Candleholder will soon be returning to the main stage! In 2025, we plan on resuming our development of the game and sharing news and sneak peeks + proper devlogs with you all. There's a LOT to update ever since the hiatus started so we should get to work soon enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game is also going through a semi-major rewrite, and some characters will be slightly redesigned (see: Dealmaker) as well as the "Hard Mode" getting almost a full rewrite. Everyone in the team is honestly really excited to soon go back to Candleholder after so long!

			<p>
				Speaking of which... we know that a lot of you were very excited to learn more about Candleholder's secret boss.
				Well, we have good and bad news...
			</p>
			<p>
				Bad news is: the secret boss was scrapped. Good news is: there'll be another in its place.
				Good thing we can show a bit of our scrapped idea for the original secret boss.
