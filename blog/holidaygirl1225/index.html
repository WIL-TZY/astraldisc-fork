                    <p>
                        This blog was made for not only sharing my collection of interests but also be
                        a hub for various oddities surrounding gaming, including glitches and creepy ARGs...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you like your stay here X) <s>Consider signing my guestbook</s> or joining my webring!

                    <p>
                        <strong>UPDATE:</strong> If you're looking for the guestbook widget I had... SORRY! I decided to
                        remove it after getting an avalanche of weirdos in my inbox! Not only that but the widget itself
                        just... decided to die on me... XD
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But no worries! I was able to go through the list and found some lovely comments left by lovely people!
                        So, I decided to pin them in this page. If you see yourself in here, thank you for signing
                        my guestbook! X)

                            <p>Don't spread this around, but... I always thought nutcrackers looked... kind of scary? Something about their mouths and expressions. I prefer the more silly ones as decoration!</p>

                            <p>I remember when my sister used to show off her new song drafts to the family, and I would always try to "sing" along (it was more like humming to the tune...). Eventually she would make it a guessing game, and we'd gather around wth friends to try and guess the song she was playing...</p>

                            <p>I do have to thank my neighbor for fueling that. My sister always made sure to tell me he didn't ACTUALLY, um... eat kids who were naughty around Christmas XP Even though sometimes she went along with the whole cryptid thing.</p>
