					<p>I can't find her Pocketspace account anymore. What is happening?</p>
					<p>Just yesterday I was looking at it (yes, do judge me) but now it's completely wiped. And no, the archive did NOT go down. I still have Azzy and Polly's profiles. I bet it's just a bug...</p>
					<p>It just feels like... the universe doesn't want me to reach her.
					<p>It's been 3 years. No messages, no calls.</p>
					<p class="deleted" title="Is it stupid if I get angry at her?&#010;For not bringing me along? Is it selfish?&#010;Am I a bad person for hating her&#010;because she's gone?">[REMOVED BY MOD]</p>
					<p>Anyway, if any of you can access <a href="/goner/hplays">THIS link</a>, let me know ASAP. Please.</p>
